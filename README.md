# About the project
**Curse's RPG Loot is a spigot plugin/datapack duo that aims to change up the survival experience by adding roleplay-themed weapons, armor, and mobs to the game.**
It modifies loot pools of the generic Minecraft experience to better immerse the player in an open world, roleplay-ready environment. **By installing the plugin, it
will automatically install all necessary dependencies & datapacks for the project to work properly, making the setup as easy as drag & drop.** There are several changes
and additions to the loot found in structures throughout all worlds, as well as a few new variations of mobs to encounter along the way.
